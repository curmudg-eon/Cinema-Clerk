/*
 Main.swift is a bot that interfaces with Discord services using the Sword library.
 The purpose of this bot is just to manage a group of friends' movie picks and watchlists.
 The backend code used to manage the actual picks and data is separated in order to allow for later development into a full stack AppleÃŸ app.
